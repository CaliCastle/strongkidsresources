			We have made some exciting and progressive changes to the Strong Kids programs in light of recent advances
			in research, theory, and science of implementation in the field of social and emotional learning "SEL".
		</p>
		<p class="center margin-v">
			Our efforts to create an effective, user-friendly, and practical mental health promotion program, coupled
			with the real-world experience and feedback we gained over nearly 20 years of research and development and
			use, have convinced us that the Strong Kids curriculum has much to offer and can be a valuable tool for
			facilitating SEL, promoting resilience, and teaching coping skills.

		<p class="center margin-v">
			We hope that users who were acquainted with the first edition of the Strong Kids programs find the updated
			versions familiar, but with new twists and fresh angles, and that new users of the Strong Kids programs find
			the second edition intuitive, cohesive, and timely.

				For the past 20 years, efforts to effectively teach social and emotional skills have been guided by a
				framework termed social and emotional learning (SEL). Within the SEL framework, social and emotional
				skills are taught in a coordinated manner using strategic planning and regular evaluations to gauge
				outcomes (Greenberg et al., 2003; Merrell & Gueldner, 2010). The goal is to provide all students with
				effective support to mitigate risk and foster resilience (Greenberg et al., 2003). A growing body of
				evidence demonstrates that social and emotional skills lead to higher academic achievement (see Durlak,
				et al., 2011). In fact, arecent report by the National Research Council (NRC; 2012) identified
				interpersonal and intrapersonal competence to be essential for building 21st century skills necessary to
				thrive in today’s global society. Further,
