			<ol class="numbered">
				<li class="faq-question">
					Has this curriculum been used before?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Yes. And with successful outcomes. See <a
								href="/Research/StrongKidsProgramResearch">Strong Kids Program Research</a> for more
						information.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					What do I need to do to get started?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Spend some time reviewing the chapters and material in the front matter. The
						front matter provides information that gives you a general sense of the intent behind the
						lessons and provides a good platform for decision-making during your lesson-delivery. Review
						each lesson before you teach it. Allow time to ensure you have all the handouts, and to
						determine whether or not you will need to make any modifications to the lesson.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Do I have to follow the scripts exactly?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">No. The scripting is primarily designed to give you a sense of the intended
						message. You can adjust the language to make sure that your students are able to understand the
						content described in the scripts.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Do I have to give the lessons in sequential order?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">The lessons are designed with an intentional sequence, however, you can
						select lessons based on needs your students may have, current, topics, or preference. If you
						elect to re-order the lessons, simply pay attention to wording that may refer to a lesson that
						you have not yet given to your students.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Can I divide a lesson into two parts?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. Be sure to take note of the "Running short on time" instructions
						provided.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					How should I group my students for in-class activities?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Group your students in a way that allows you to focus on any students you are
						particularly concerned about, while maintaining good classroom behavior management practices.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					How do I work the homework assignments into the class time?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Some teachers have found it helpful for students to complete or at least
						start the homework assignment in class. Some teachers also use homework in the review section of
						a new lesson to go over previously learned concepts.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Can I use situations that are currently happening in my classroom to illustrate concepts in the
					lessons?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Yes. Examples are provided in the curriculum, but you can make up your own.
						If you use situations that are currently happening in your classroom, be sure to remain
						sensitive to students’ feelings and respect confidentiality by addressing sensitive subjects
						anonymously or with modifications to the scenario that remove judgment and allow for multiple
						perspectives.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					What do I do if a student is experiencing emotional difficulties during the course of a lesson?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">If you believe a student is having a difficult time with the curriculum
						content, becomes upset or seems distressed, first attempt to work with the student to determine
						how to proceed in the moment and then notify your school psychologist or counselor as
						appropriate.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Are the strong kids programs pre-requisites for each other?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">No. As in the original programs, Strong Kids—Grades 3–5 is not a prerequisite
						to Strong Kids—Grades 6–8, and Strong Kids—Grades 6–8 is not a prerequisite to Strong Teens.
						Thus, students can benefit from the programs regardless of the level at which the student first
						receives instruction.

			<h2 class="section-heading">Frequently Asked Questions for Parents</h2>
			<ol class="numbered">
				<li class="faq-question">
					Is this a psychological test?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">No. The Strong Kids Curriculum does not provide a psychological evaluation, or diagnosis of your child. Strong kids is a social emotional curriculum that simply explores the emotions that children typically encounter on a day to day basis.</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Will my child have to share personal stories about themselves or about our family?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">In the Strong Kids Curriculum students will answer hypothetical questions, role play, and explore the emotions of fictional characters. They are encouraged to monitor their own emotions and occasionally compare their emotions to the emotions of the characters in the lessons. During discussion students will share any insights they may have or connections they may make during the lesson, and while these may sometimes be personal disclosures, most lessons do not promote the sharing of personal information or intimate family details.</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					How much class time will be dedicated to these lessons?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">If Strong Kids is being implemented in your student’s school your student’s teacher and administrators will be responsible for selecting a time that fits into your student’s academic schedule without causing undue disruption to your student’s academic schedule. Schools will vary in terms of their implementation design.</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					Can I use Strong Kids at home with my children?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Yes. Although Strong Kids is written from the perspective of a school delivery, the content and activities are modifiable and can be used in a variety of settings. In addition to implementing the curriculum at home, parents can also consider supporting a school’s implementation of Strong Kids, by working with teachers to reinforce the principles of each lesson at home.</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					My child has a specific problem that I am hoping Strong Kids will fix. Can Strong Kids fix it for my child?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">Strong Kids will give most children an additional array of skills to choose from. With the appropriate reinforcement, sufficient practice, and positive encouragement, children will learn to apply new skills to situations outside of the classroom environment. Strong Kids reinforces consequences of using (or not using) the skills, problem-solving, and empathy. The more exposure a child has to problem-solving, and the contemplation of consequences, the greater the likelihood that his or her behavior may change as a result.</div>
				</li>
				<li class="faq-question">
					My child learned about Strong Kids in elementary or middle school, is it the same material?
					<br>
					<div class="faq-answer">The Strong Kids (3 – 5, and 6 – 8) and Strong Teens emphasize the same skills using age-appropriate examples and scenarios. A child who has already done Strong Kids in a prior grade or school, will encounter the same concepts but will be approaching them with a different perspective.</div>
