			Programmatic-level changes: How do the programs differ overall?
		</h2>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>We better address issues that students increasingly experience in our global society.</b> We integrate
			sociocultural issues in discussions of emotional awareness, expression, and empathy. Because with whom and
			where we express our emotions can be just as important as how we express our emotions, we discuss emotional
			expression in terms of not just our actions but also the context or setting. Throughout the programs, we use
			more current and authentic examples and reference problems that students today are likely to experience,
			such as social networking dilemmas, stereotypes, and other complex social situations. We use "twists" in
			examples, which change a small aspect of the example, thereby altering the way students perceive the
			situation and the outcome. We also include more modern graphics to pique the interest of students and help
			ground the more abstract ideas.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>Build a tolerance for discomfort and reduce reactivity.</b> Distressing emotions such as anger or sadness
			are discussed in this edition using a slightly different orientation. Rather than conveying only the message
			that uncomfortable feelings are something to change or fix, we emphasize the value of simply listening to
			what our bodies are communicating through these emotions. Also, to better address SEL issues associated with
			students who internalize their emotions, we discuss both the potential negative consequences of acting out
			and withdrawing, hiding, and repressing our emotions.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>We added a new lesson, Positive Living!</b> This new lesson promotes a sense of personal responsibility
			over daily behaviors and actions and promotes the development of healthy habits across school, home, and
			community settings. To build on these concepts, the next lesson is centered on creating strong, SMART
			(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) goals.

			Changes across the levels: How does Strong Kids—Grades 3–5 differ from Strong Kids—Grades 6–8, and how does
			Strong Kids—Grades 6–8 differ from Strong Teens?
		</h2>
		<p class="margin-v">
			The new programs have been revised to better target, differentiate, and address developmental considerations
			of SEL. The SEL topics bring different contexts and different meanings for students as they age. Making a
			responsible decision can present more complex considerations for an adolescent than for a student in third
			grade. Thus, although the major objectives remain unchanged across the levels, the ways in which the lessons
			approach the objectives are adjusted to fit the development of the student. As the levels advance, the
			instruction and examples become increasingly sophisticated and abstract. Whereas Strong Kids focuses on more
			concrete concepts and issues relevant to elementary and middle school, Strong Teens addresses more abstract
			concepts and uses examples with more complex social situations and issues that are more relevant to teens,
			such as postsecondary planning.
