			Programmatic-level changes: How do the programs differ overall?
		</h2>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>We better address issues that students increasingly experience in our global society.</b> We integrate
			sociocultural issues in discussions of emotional awareness, expression, and empathy. Because with whom and
			where we express our emotions can be just as important as how we express our emotions, we discuss emotional
			expression in terms of not just our actions but also the context or setting. Throughout the programs, we use
			more current and authentic examples and reference problems that students today are likely to experience,
			such as social networking dilemmas, stereotypes, and other complex social situations. We use "twists" in
			examples, which change a small aspect of the example, thereby altering the way students perceive the
			situation and the outcome. We also include more modern graphics to pique the interest of students and help
			ground the more abstract ideas.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>Build a tolerance for discomfort and reduce reactivity.</b> Distressing emotions such as anger or sadness
			are discussed in this edition using a slightly different orientation. Rather than conveying only the message
			that uncomfortable feelings are something to change or fix, we emphasize the value of simply listening to
			what our bodies are communicating through these emotions. Also, to better address SEL issues associated with
			students who internalize their emotions, we discuss both the potential negative consequences of acting out
			and withdrawing, hiding, and repressing our emotions.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<b>We added a new lesson, Positive Living!</b> This new lesson promotes a sense of personal responsibility
			over daily behaviors and actions and promotes the development of healthy habits across school, home, and
			community settings. To build on these concepts, the next lesson is centered on creating strong, SMART
			(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) goals.

			Changes across the levels: How does Strong Kids—Grades 3–5 differ from Strong Kids—Grades 6–8, and how does
			Strong Kids—Grades 6–8 differ from Strong Teens?
		</h2>
		<p class="margin-v">
			The new programs have been revised to better target, differentiate, and address developmental considerations
			of SEL. The SEL topics bring different contexts and different meanings for students as they age. Making a
			responsible decision can present more complex considerations for an adolescent than for a student in third
			grade. Thus, although the major objectives remain unchanged across the levels, the ways in which the lessons
			approach the objectives are adjusted to fit the development of the student. As the levels advance, the
			instruction and examples become increasingly sophisticated and abstract. Whereas Strong Kids focuses on more
			concrete concepts and issues relevant to elementary and middle school, Strong Teens addresses more abstract
			concepts and uses examples with more complex social situations and issues that are more relevant to teens,
			such as postsecondary planning.

		What’s New in Strong Start?
	</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<em class="margin-v section-heading">
			Our program is aligned to the latest CASEL social and emotional competencies
		</em>
		<p class="margin-v">
			<a href="http://www.casel.org/">The Collaborative for Academic and Social Emotional Learning</a> (CASEL) is an organization that leads efforts
			to promote social and emotional learning in research, policy, and practice. This organization advocates for
			educational settings and community agencies to ensure that children are learning about five essential
			personal competencies including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness,
			relationship development, and responsible decision-making.
		</p>
		<p class="margin-v">
			In the second edition of Strong Start—Grades K–2, we have aimed to explicitly align lessons to these
			critical competencies. At the top of each lesson, the particular competencies addressed are listed.
		</p>
		<em class="margin-v section-heading">
			Our content changes provide more opportunities for student growth
		</em>
		<p class="margin-v">We have shortened scripts for group leaders and incorporated more opportunities for students
			to learn through active engagement. We also changed the order of particular lessons to foster increased
			foundational knowledge of emotional knowledge and self-awareness.</p>
		<p class="margin-v">We tweaked wording throughout the curriculum to highlight that it is okay and important to
			experience all feelings, but some make us feel good and others make us feel not so good on the inside. We
			have also introduced new terminology such as stuck (see Lesson 7) to describe situations when we may be
			perseverating and having a hard time letting go of worries.</p>
		<em class="margin-v section-heading">
			Our new lesson components continue to follow a standardized format but offer increased teaching and learning opportunities
