						<b>Laura L. Feuerborn, PhD, NCSP</b> is an Associate Professor at the University of Washington,
						Tacoma.
						Dr. Feuerborn received her PhD in School Psychology from the University of Oregon in 2004, and
						joined the University of Washington, Tacoma faculty in 2006. Dr. Feuerborn has both research and
						teaching expertise in the field of social, emotional, and behavioral supports across the levels
						of the student, the teacher, and the system. Dr. Feuerborn developed—and now teaches—coursework
						for practicing teachers in social and emotional learning (SEL) and systems change. She also
						teaches positive behavior supports, collaboration and consultation, and mentors graduate
						students in the development and completion of their degree capstone projects. Like her teaching,
						her research and publications focus on SEL and systems change, particularly in relation to
						positive behavior supports in secondary schools. She is lead author of the Staff Perceptions of
						Behavior and Discipline (SPBD) needs assessment tool (see companion website www.spbdsupport.com
						for more information). Recently, Dr. Feuerborn spent her sabbatical living on a university
						campus in China, collaborating with teachers, researchers, and clinicians throughout Southeast
						Asia to support their SEL efforts. Dr. Feuerborn frequently presents her works at conferences
						and partners with schools to help them manage resistance to change and scale-up positive
						discipline practices and SEL.
